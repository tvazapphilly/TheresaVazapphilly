											<h3>Naval Research Enterprise Internship Program Fall Engagment</h3>
											<p>During the fall semester, I interned with the Department of the Navy under the mentorship of Dr. Prithviraj Dasgupta, where I worked as part of a team-based project focused on machine learning (ML) and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). This internship provided me with both foundational and intermediate knowledge of ML and GenAI concepts, as well as valuable hands-on experience applying these techniques to real-world problems relevant to Naval software systems.
												Throughout the internship, I strengthened my understanding of core machine learning principles, including reinforcement learning, model training, and evaluation metrics. Working in a collaborative team setting helped me improve my technical communication skills, as I frequently discussed design decisions, model performance, and experimental results with my peers and mentors.
												A major component of my learning culminated in the Taxi-v3 final project, where I applied reinforcement learning techniques to train an agent to navigate a grid-based environment efficiently. Through this project, I implemented and evaluated algorithms such as tabular Q-learning, gaining practical experience with state spaces, reward structures, exploration vs. exploitation strategies, and convergence behavior. Debugging issues such as unstable rewards and performance crashes deepened my understanding of how algorithmic choices and hyperparameters impact learning outcomes. This project reinforced the importance of iterative experimentation, visualization of results, and critical evaluation of model behavior.</p>

											<h3>Research Assistant & Camp Facilitator, Q-JAM Quantum Information Science Summer Camp</h3>
											<p>Worked under the mentorship of Dr. Raquel Coelho to organize and support a week-long, research-based summer camp that introduced high school students to quantum information science through creative game design and storytelling. Collaborated with an interdisciplinary team of physicists, computer scientists, and designers to develop educational activities centered on key quantum concepts, including superposition, entanglement, and quantum measurement. Helped design and facilitate interactive workshops and hands-on learning experiences that translated abstract and complex quantum ideas into accessible, engaging formats for students.
												Throughout the program, I supported student learning by encouraging creativity, guiding group discussions, and fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment. I also assisted in leading conversations on the broader implications of quantum technologies and their potential impact on science, technology, and society.
												In addition to instructional and organizational responsibilities, I contributed to the analysis and documentation of the camp’s educational outcomes. This work culminated in co-authoring a research paper titled “Board Game-Making as a Pathway to Quantum Information Science Education for Youth,” which examines how game-based learning can effectively introduce quantum concepts to younger audiences. The paper was submitted for academic review, providing valuable experience in educational research, academic writing, and dissemination of findings.</p>

											<h3>Flight Delay Prediction Project</h3>
											<p>Developed a machine learning model in Python to predict flight delays based on past flight and weather data for INFSCI 0510 (Data Analytics). Developed predictive models using Python and machine learning libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) to forecast flight delays. Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis on historical flight and weather datasets. Implemented multiple regression algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and metrics. </p>

											<h3>Client Project: Pitt Sustainability Usability Report </h3>
											<p>Collaborated with a team to evaluate the usability and accessibility of Sustainable.Pitt.edu for ENGCMP 1430 (Usability Testing in Technical Writing). Conducted a usability and accessibility evaluation of Sustainable.Pitt.edu using qualitative methods including user interviews, heuristic analysis, and empathy mapping. Used user feedback and heuristic data to identify usability barriers affecting engagement with sustainability content. Compiled recommendations and design improvements in a UX report aimed at improving user experience and accessibility.</p>

											<h3>Arduino Project: Strawberry Shortcake’s Magic Oven</h3>
											<p>With a partner, we designed and built an interactive, baking-themed toy oven using Arduino and 3D printing for ENGLIT 1201 (Digital Narrative and Interactive Design). Integrated LED lights, a buzzer, motors, and a button to simulate the baking process, creating an engaging hands-on experience that combined storytelling with electronics. </p>

											<h3>Unity Project: The Bandit Husband </h3>
											<p>With a partner, we designed and develop a 2D platformer video game in Unity for ENGLIT 1201 (Digital Narrative and Interactive Design), based on the children’s book and movie The Princess Bride. Implemented core gameplay mechanics including player movement, jumping, enemy interactions, and collectible items using C# scripting. Designed and built multiple levels that reflect key story moments, blending narrative storytelling with interactive game elements.</p>
