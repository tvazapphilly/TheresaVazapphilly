											<h3>Research Assistant & Camp Facilitator, Q-JAM Quantum Information Science Summer Camp</h3>
											<p>Worked under Dr. Raquel Coelho to help organize and run a week-long, research-based summer camp introducing high school students to quantum information science through creative game design and storytelling. Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team including physicists, computer scientists, and designers to explore foundational quantum concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum measurement. Facilitated workshops and hands-on activities that translated abstract quantum topics into accessible, engaging formats. Supported student learning, encouraged creative experimentation, and helped lead discussions on the ethical and societal implications of emerging quantum technologies and their potential to shape the future.</p>

											<h3>Flight Delay Prediction Project</h3>
											<p>Developed a machine learning model in Python to predict flight delays based on historical flight and weather data for INFSCI 0510 (Data Analytics). Developed predictive models using Python and machine learning libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) to forecast flight delays. Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis on historical flight and weather datasets. Implemented multiple regression algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and metrics such as MAE and RMSE. </p>

											<h3>Client Project: Pitt Sustainability Usability Report </h3>
											<p>Collaborated with a team to evaluate the usability and accessibility of Sustainable.Pitt.edu for ENGCMP 1430 (Usability Testing in Technical Writing). Conducted a usability and accessibility evaluation of Sustainable.Pitt.edu using qualitative methods including user interviews, heuristic analysis, and empathy mapping. Synthesized user feedback and heuristic violations to identify usability barriers affecting engagement with sustainability content. Compiled actionable recommendations and design improvements in a comprehensive UX report aimed at enhancing user experience and accessibility compliance.</p>
