											<h3>Research Assistant & Camp Facilitator, Q-JAM Quantum Information Science Summer Camp</h3>
											<p>Worked under Dr. Raquel Coelho to help organize and run a week-long, research-based summer camp introducing high school students to quantum information science through creative game design and storytelling. Collaborated with a team including physicists, computer scientists, and designers to explore quantum concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum measurement. Facilitated workshops and hands-on activities that translated abstract quantum topics into accessible, engaging formats for students. Supported learning, encouraged creativity, and helped lead discussions on the implications of quantum technologies and their potential to shape the future.</p>

											<h3>Flight Delay Prediction Project</h3>
											<p>Developed a machine learning model in Python to predict flight delays based on past flight and weather data for INFSCI 0510 (Data Analytics). Developed predictive models using Python and machine learning libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) to forecast flight delays. Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis on historical flight and weather datasets. Implemented multiple regression algorithms including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and metrics. </p>
